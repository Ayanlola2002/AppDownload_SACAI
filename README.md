# AppDownload_SACAI

The goal for this project is to find the consumers using mobile devices (phones and tablets) and target them with ads messages to drive an app download.
We work with a company call Beeswax to bid on our behalf.

Our project here is to interface with Beeswax completely through data, for simplicity.
At a high level, the architecture look something like this:

We have 20 features conversions, clicks, app_bundle, ad_position, app_id, app_name, geo_city, inventory_source, platform_browser_version, platform_device_model, video_companion_required, video_completes, video_midpoints, video_plays, video_q3s, placement_type, banner_width, bid_floor_micros, exchange_device_make, publisher_id
